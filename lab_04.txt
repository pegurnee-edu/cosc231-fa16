Lab 4
take one of the following webpages:

http://www.emunix.emich.edu/~evett/
http://www.emunix.emich.edu/~sverdlik/
http://www.emunix.emich.edu/~haynes/311/fa16

and bring it up to the standards that we expect from a webpage:

- html5 valid (by using https://validator.w3.org/)
- css3 valid (http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- no erroneous red html tags or entities in firefox view source
- no inline css
- good alignment of html and css

after the standards are met, without removing content, make the site look 'nice':

- get good looking fonts
- use color effectively (background and font color)
- structure content in a way that is accessible for the users of the site (which are both the professor and student)

This assignment is may be difficult for many because of the trouble with defining 'nice' looking, hopefully we've all seen enough bad websites to know one when we see one; we're trying to add style to a site to create a visually appealing website.
