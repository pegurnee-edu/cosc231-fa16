Create a form with a username and password, along with 'Login' and 'Register' buttons.

When the user clicks 'Login' for the first time, the page uses AJAX to load a file of valid usernames and checks if the username and password exist. Give a user response of either success or failiure.

When the user clicks 'Register', the username and password are validated against the following rules:
    -usernames must
        start with a '$' (dollar sign character, no quotes)
        have no capital letters
        have no numbers in the first four characters
    -passwords must
        not be password
        be longer than 15 characters OR
            be at least 8 characters
            use at least one of the following: &%$^#@=
            have at least 2 numbers that are not at either the beginning or the end NOR can they be next to each other within the password
            have at least 2 uppercase and 2 lowercase characters
