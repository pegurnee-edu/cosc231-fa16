# Giving Up on Sonic

- **Distributed:** *November 2nd*
- **Proposal Writeup:** *November 9th*
- **Due:** *November 21st*

### Description:

After finally admitting that Sonic games don't sell, Sega has decided to
move into other game types. They have hired you to make a new game that will
spark the rabid excitement that existed with early Sonic games. Unfortunately,
Sega has no idea what is fun anymore (see sentence 1), so it is up to you to
impress them.

### Spec:

- Create a simple top down 2d video game
  - Nothing too complex, maybe 40 seconds of play time
- The game should take place on a grid
  - Using a table, collection of divs, or the canvas element
- The game that is being played is less important than the fact that the following is implemented:
  - Randomized 'world' generation
  - Obstacles - monsters, time limit
  - Some sort of scoring mechanism - pickup fruit, defeat monsters, finish maze in enough time
  - Insertion of new objects while game is running - bullets, monsters, prizes
  - High score is saved, notification is given if a new high score is set

### Further Exploration
- [Arsho Hunts][ashro-link]
- [Battle for Gold][gold-link]
- [Fire Fighting][fire-link]
- [Mark-it][mark-link]

## Expectations:

- work alone or with one partner
- html pages will be html5 compliant (tested [here][html5])
- css pages will be css3 compliant (tested [here][css3])
- all source code will show proper/consistent formatting
- no erroneous red code in firefox html preview
- web site will be hosted on people.emich

## Deliverables:

- Proposal Writeup:
  1. One page writeup of game Spec
  1. Contains responsibilities for the group members
  1. Expected technologies used
- Final Project:
  1. Print out of all source code due 7:20pm on the 21th
  1. Demo/walkthrough in class

## Requirements for success:

- Timers for time dependent events
- WebStorage/Cookies for high scores
- Keyboard control for user interaction
- *use of canvas is not a requirement for success, but it might make some things easier*
