This is not to be a stressful final project, but I do need the groups to turn in research that was gathered; whether it is in the form of a powerpoint presentation or articles referenced.

Here are some ethics topics! Get into groups of 4-5, choose at topic, and give a short (5-7 minute) talk/presentation on the subject. I'll try to find popcorn.
